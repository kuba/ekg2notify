Requirements:
    * ekg2 compiled with python support
    * libnotify

Optionally:
    * cryptcat (on both machines)

How to:
    remote:~$ mkfifo notify
    ekg2 (remote): /python:load notify
                   /set notify:sessions "<session-name> [<another-session>...]"
                   /set notify:highlights "<highlighted-word> [<another-word>...]"

    # Without cryptcat
    local$ ./client.sh ssh <host> <port>

    # With cryptcat
    remote$ ./cryptcat-server.sh
    local$ ./client cryptcat
    # Remember to change deafult connection params inside the scripts

    # To test it
    ekg2 (remote): /notify-test Muhahah! It works :)
